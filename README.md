# Task & Notes Dashboard

A modern, glassmorphism‑styled **Task & Notes Dashboard** built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
It combines a todo list and a notes editor, and is designed as a **concept revision project** to practice core JavaScript topics like DOM, events, functions, arrays, OOP, and localStorage. [web:21][web:22][web:29]
